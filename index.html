        <br>
        
        <p>
          Hello folks!<br>
          I feel it quite awkward to introduce myself in formal notes, but keeping the protocol, I will try my best. So myself Priyam Bajpai. I am crrently a freshman at Indian Institute of Information Technology SriCity, pursuing my B.Tech in CSE. Many a times I have been asked about the topics where my interest lies in. Frankly speaking, I really didn't have an answer until some time back. The reason was that the nuances of Computer science and Technology were quite new to an ignorant and oblivious child like me. I usually don't open up to people so much but there is always a hell lot of stuff going on my mind. I was mesmerised by the plethora of information and sub-disciplines the subject provided us. Till now I had not done anything more than copy and paste and some random word or excel files in computer. So the vast syllabus of core CS and the unnecessary extra syllabus of various other subjects combined gave me a headache. I could not decide where to step and where to progress.     
        </p>
         Things have sorted and the conditions have been much better now, to my relief. I have never been a tech-savvy person but at the same time I was always fascinated into computer analytics. The moment I started analysing myself on the subject, I hit a core point.
         I have a lot of interest in languages, be it of any type. I can't fathom why but I always try to learn any new language whenever I get a chance. The same interest was put forth by me for programming languages as well. The interest slowly shifted my focus into competitive programming since it is the only field where pre-requisites and experiences are over-powered by logic and a bit of labour. I still like attempting questions that boggle my mind. By the way, don't temp into thinking that I am goot in competitive programming, I am actually a disaster at it. But I still love doing it. So destiny gave me a lot of time to sit and restructure myself in this period of quarantine. And thanks to coursera for having provided an oppurtunity to learn for free that I found out many courses of my interest on it. This particular course of web designing is very dear to me, since I learned a lot from it. And I am feeling very elated on the fact that I am on the verge of completion and am currently working on my capstone project. 
        <p>
          At the end I would like to say that I chose to express myself in this project for two reasons - First, because I didn't have anything as such to write about the technical me in details. And second is that I love to write whenever I get time. My thoughts are very close to my heart. So if at all you have some time to spare and your mind did not blow after reading my shit here, Please do read my articles. I am not sure you would agree with them but am sure you would like them.<br>Cheers!!

        <br>
       <p>In a persistently changing world of today, we all tend to run behind our interests and achieve our goals. We all learned, with time, to become more pragmatic and the subtler aspects of life were eventually sacrificed for the so called 'meaningful life'. This used to work fine until some time. But slowly and gradually, we realised that the instinct of craving for the 'goal' and the tedium of achieving it could give us nothing more than momentary happiness. Even after combining it with the incentives assured aftermath, one could easily feel the absence of something, which was very intimidating otherwise. This feeling of emptiness has haunted almost all of our minds at some point of time. Happiness is not an attribute of the goal - it associates itself with the process itself. That very process which is being neglected for the goal! It has created a vicious cycle wherein we are neglecting something which we want to have  by us every moment! What an irony.</p>

        <p>It has been the same story for most of the normal us, with our mind playing the conjuring with us, involving and affecting us with its insidious acts. And we could not master over this trickster yet. The mind is meant to be a slave and not a master. It has wonderful suggestions when churned for goodness, and at the same time, the most terrible thoughts when set free - like a horse without reigns. The wise men of the yore realised this fact very soon.<br><br> &quot; AHAM BRAHMAASMI! &quot;<br><br>
        It literally means - I am the creator.This small statement holds the true essence of the extra dimension of life that  we hold within us- our mind. When expanded in the right manner, we can feel the power of this mind, that creates a new world inside us through  creativity which manifests into reality in the form of our perceptions. Such is the power of this mind, that makes us the Brahma of the world within us. the thoughts that we think to be our are actually instances of manifestation of this world. Whether we suffer or enjoy, is all about how we perceive the outer world through this inner world. Hence said that happiness is a state of being and not the goal itself. In the pursuit of our goals in this fast changing world, we have, for our benefits, restricted this world to morbid boundaries. The creativity is exhausted almost completely to create something common! We are all trying to be a same type of person, a person whom we find ideal according to our needs. This has lead to  a situation wherein the different expanding worlds are turning out to be the same, eventually losing their uniqueness - that uniqueness which is the elixir of life. That elixir which has led to the sustainance of this world. The real happiness lies in the jovial conjugation of this outer and inner world, a conjugation that demands no perfection, but is still perfect in itself. That's how this dimension proceeds.</p> 

        <p>Therefore, in order to find true happiness, we ought to shun the habit of looking for happiness in petty materials and belongings, and rather we should start enjoying the present state of our being, thanking the holy creator for almost all things - small or large, visible or invisible, perfect or imperfect that co-exist with us to create the perfect conjugation of the two imperfect worlds.And believe me, happiness found this way, would fill all the void in the life, and would drive us closer to the eternal imperfect truth, away from the gullible perfect illusion.</p>

        <h1 id="h3id" class="animation-element slide-left">My Hostel</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
        The topic to my essay might seem quite bland and tasteless to most of the readers. But, at this point of time,
        when I am experiencing the same phase in my life, I am finally able to pen my thoughts down. For a formal
        beginning I will try to define a hostel in the most naive and crude way. A hostel is a shelter for the students
        who come from far off places. Students live there with each other and learn the value of discipline and
        co-operation. The atmosphere of a hostel is conducive to study. Generally, hostels are situated close to school
        or college. Thus the teachers have direct watch and supervision over the students in the hostels.Further, it
        saves time of the students for study. The hostel life is a disciplined life. Hostels actually provide us
        something more than mere accommodation. They give us a new life, a type of life which we like and dislike at the
        same time. It is not easy to start a new life all alone with almost no aid by our side. At the same time, it
        gives us an exposure of the outer world and its ways of functioning. It also acts as a mirror to our inner self
        wherein we get a chance to understand who we actually are. For most of us, hostel life apparently seems quite
        fascinating and colourful, but only till we begin experiencing it. It changes our lives in a drastic way. It
        takes a few days for us to become a mature and aware adult from an oblivious and carefree child. The earlier
        days of hostels are not easy for anyone, but things go down well with the passage of time. There are a lot of
        feelings in the soft corner of our hearts, but we learn the art of concealing them and try to prepare ourselves
        of the world ahead.

        The earlier days are filled with nostalgia, because we are not able to adjust to the new environment, specially
        with the food and the accommodation. Food is the worst part and the most morbid aspect of our lives. Specially
        for pupils who have come from far places. Hostels can provide us with all the luxuries but they lack comfort.
        The best part part of our lives are our friends, partially because they are on the same page as we are. These
        days give us the best of our friends and confidante. They intrude in our personal space, our lives and
        eventually become an indispensable part of our lives. We also learn about people and the conjuring hidden behind
        convincing gestures. We start to live our lives with full freedom and liberty. But with freedom, comes
        responsibilities. We tend to forget those and end up messing our lives. The time is solely under our own control
        and we need to utilize it with our brains. Also college environment and hostel life, in a combined way, give us
        a wholesome simulation of the life that waits for us ahead. There is absolutely no one to cherish our happy
        moments with us, and to share our sorrow.
        </p>
        <p>
        Hostel life makes us all rounder in terms of all types of work. Right from waking up to sleeping, from
        maintaining ourselves, to taking care of our belongings. With tedium and patience by our side, we eventually
        learn these things and become self dependent.. Also our true self and character comes out and we are able to
        understand ourselves better. It seems quite paranoid to make new friends and acquaintances, specially when we
        are from different backgrounds and have different opinions over matters. But what matters the most is how we
        feel about each other and if that bond is strong, people are able to forget their differences and we find an
        ocean of brotherhood and warmth, which we are usually searching for. There is

        another aspect of hostels, our seniors. Seniors are just like our mentors, who constantly pretend to be quite
        dangerous and over-imposing. But they prove to be our best aides as time passes. Moreover, they are a constant
        source of knowledge and experiences, as they have faced all those situations in their lives also. the same
        implies to the authorities which seem to be quite intruding and nosey over our matters. But eventually we learn
        that all strictness and scolding are actually meant to keep us in track. The most fearful moment of a fresher's
        life is an unwanted rendezvous with seniors, especially in their rooms. It is popularly known as an introduction
        session and one can not deny the importance these sessions exercise in our personality

        development later on. These days teach us the way of living, of making friends, of living the life to its
        fullest and stripe- off our agonies and arrogance. It just like getting a new big family and life altogether.
        </p>
        <p>
        Thus I can definitely say that this can be the best or the worst chapter of our lives, depending on how we perceive it
        altogether. The sole fact that is not going to change is that we have to live here and get all the best that we can for
        ourselves, out of it. The faster we understand this fact, the better it is for us. It was the best I could write to
        share my feelings about hostel life. With all its best and worst sides and aspects, this is our hostel life, the avenue
        for our future destination, and home to a lot of memories!!
